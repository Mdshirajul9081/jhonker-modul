        <p>The quadrangular structure consists of 177 cells and a traditional Buddhist stupa in the centre. The rooms were used by the monks for accommodation and meditation. In addition to the large number of stupas and shrines of various sizes and shapes, terracotta plaques, stone sculptures, inscriptions, coins, ceramics etc. have been discovered.

          The site houses the architectural remains of a vast Buddhist monastery, Somapura Mahavihara, covering 11 hectares (27 acres). It was an important intellectual centre for Dharmic Traditions such as Buddhists (Buddha Dharma), Jains (Jaina Dharma) and Hindus (Sanatana Dharma) alike.[8] The 8.5-hectare (21-acre) complex has 177 cells, viharas, numerous stupas, temples and a number of other ancillary buildings.[9] The outside walls with ornamental terracotta plaques still display the influence of these three religions.
          
          In acreage, Somapura was the largest of the mahaviharas.[10] According to Sukumar Dutt, the complex was dominated by a temple, which was strongly reminiscent of Hindu-Buddhist temples of Burma, Java and Cambodia, reproducing the cruciform basement, terraced structure with inset chambers and gradually dwindling pyramid form ... during the age of the Palas some sort of intercourse between eastern India and south-east Asia existed."[11] Another commented, "there can be no doubt that this style of architecture has most profoundly influenced that of Burma, Java and Cambodia. The nearest approximation to the plan and the superstructure of the Paharpur temple is afforded by the temples known as Chandi Loro Jongrang and Chandi Sevu of Prambanam in Central Java."[11]</p>

          <p>While the external wall was built from bricks,[2] the exterior of the mosque[1] itself and much of the floor inside[2] was made entirely of stone.[1] Three types of stone were used in the construction of the mosque: sand stone, granite, and marble.[2]  The shape of the mosque is a basic rectangle with rounded edges.[1] Each of the four corners of the building have rounded, octagonal towers.[6][7] Along the roof of the mosque, there are stone gutters to drain rainwater.[2] The exterior walls themselves are divided into two parts (top and bottom), separated by mouldings. The mouldings also serve as a border for decorative panels on the exterior of the mosque. The northern and southern exterior walls each have screened windows.[1] The eastern wall of the mosque contains three blind[6] multifoiled[2] arches.[6][7] This was a new style of arch created with the construction of the Kusumba Mosque, distinguishing it from other mosques in the region. After the mosque was built, local artisans from the Kusumba village became trained in this style of arch. As a result, there are other similar arches in terracotta temples and mosques that were built after the Kusumba mosque. The central arch of these three was the main entrance to the mosque.[2] This arch is decorated with floral motifs, mostly rosettes. These rosettes were a repeated motif and can be found throughout other parts of the Kusumba Mosque.[1]

            The exterior walls of the mosque are covered in shallow relief carvings.[1] All the carvings on the external parts of the mosque are quite detailed and were made by skilled artisans. Compared to other mosques in Bangladesh, the work on the Kusumba Mosque is significantly more intricate. On the other hand, the structure of the mosque itself is more simple relative to other Bangladeshi mosques.[2] This is especially visible in the construction of the interior courtyard, which does not contain as many internal structures and features as other Bangladeshi mosques.[3] In addition to these carvings, there is an inscription located on the exterior of the mosque that includes the date of construction and who it was built by.[8] The entire inscription is written in Arabic,[8] specifically in the Tughra writing style.[2] The only exception to this is the part of the inscription indicating who built the mosque. This is written in Persian.[8]</p>
